.SH NAME
parkill \- Kill all processes running a specified command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B parkill [ -debug ] [ -verbose ] [ -user=name ] program
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBparkill\fP kills all processes running a specified command.

Many systems also have the "killall" command; this should be used instead
if it is available.

This script relies on the ps command; where possible, it uses the
/proc/<pid>/cmdline interface to more reliably access the commandline
(to avoid matching command line parameters as if they were functions).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-debug
Print debug information.
.TP
.B \-verbose
Be verbose.
.TP
.B \--user=name
Only kill processes belonging to a particular user. Root privileges are required for this option.
