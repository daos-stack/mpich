\fB\-s\fR \fB\-v\fR [\-1] [\-c]
.PP
\fB\-\-totalnum\fR specifies the total number of mpds to start; at least
.IP
one mpd will be started locally, and others on the machines specified
by the file argument; by default, only one mpd per host will be
started even if the hostname occurs multiple times in the hosts file
.PP
\fB\-1\fR means remove the restriction of starting only one mpd per machine;
.IP
in this case, at most the first mpd on a host will have a console
.PP
\fB\-\-file\fR specifies the file of machines to start the rest of the mpds on;
.IP
it defaults to mpd.hosts
.PP
\fB\-\-mpd\fR specifies the full path name of mpd on the remote hosts if it is
.IP
not in your path
.PP
\fB\-\-rsh\fR specifies the name of the command used to start remote mpds; it
.IP
defaults to ssh; an alternative is rsh
.PP
\fB\-\-shell\fR says that the Bourne shell is your default for rsh'
\fB\-\-verbose\fR shows the ssh attempts as they occur; it does not provide
.IP
confirmation that the sshs were successful
.PP
\fB\-\-loccons\fR says you do not want a console available on local mpd(s)
\fB\-\-remcons\fR says you do not want consoles available on remote mpd(s)
\fB\-\-ncpus\fR indicates how many cpus you want to show for the local machine;
.IP
others are listed in the hosts file
.PP
\fB\-\-ifhn\fR indicates the interface hostname to use for the local mpd; others
.IP
may be specified in the hostsfile
.PP
\fB\-\-chkup\fR requests that mpdboot try to verify that the hosts in the host file
.IP
are up before attempting start mpds on any of them; it just checks the number
of hosts specified by \fB\-n\fR
.PP
\fB\-\-chkuponly\fR requests that mpdboot try to verify that the hosts in the host file
.IP
are up; it then terminates; it just checks the number of hosts specified by \fB\-n\fR
.PP
\fB\-\-maxbranch\fR indicates the maximum number of mpds to enter the ring under another;
.IP
the default is 4
