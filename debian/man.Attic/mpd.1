.SH NAME
mpd \- manual page for mpd daemon
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: mpd [\-\-host=<host> \fB\-\-port=\fR<portnum>] [\-\-noconsole]
.IP
[\-\-trace] [\-\-echo] [\-\-daemon] [\-\-bulletproof] \fB\-\-ncpus=\fR<ncpus>
[\-\-ifhn=<interface\-hostname>] [\-\-listenport=<listenport>]
[\-\-pid=<pidfilename>] \fB\-\-tmpdir=\fR<tmpdir>] [\-zc] [\-\-debug]
.PP
Some long parameter names may be abbreviated to their first letters by using
.IP
only one hyphen and no equal sign:
.IP
mpd \fB\-h\fR donner \fB\-p\fR 4268 \fB\-n\fR
.IP
is equivalent to
.IP
mpd \fB\-\-host\fR=\fImagpie\fR \fB\-\-port\fR=\fI4268\fR \fB\-\-noconsole\fR
.PP
\fB\-\-host\fR and \fB\-\-port\fR must be specified together; they tell the new mpd where
.TP
to enter an existing ring;
if they are omitted, the new mpd forms a
.IP
stand\-alone ring that other mpds may enter later
.PP
\fB\-\-noconsole\fR is useful for running 2 mpds on the same machine; only one of
.IP
them will accept mpd commands
.PP
\fB\-\-trace\fR yields lots of traces thru mpd routines; currently too verbose
\fB\-\-debug\fR turns on some debugging prints; currently not verbose enough
\fB\-\-echo\fR causes the mpd echo its listener port by which other mpds may connect
\fB\-\-daemon\fR causes mpd to run backgrounded, with no controlling tty
\fB\-\-bulletproof\fR says to turn bulletproofing on (experimental)
\fB\-\-ncpus\fR indicates how many cpus are on the local host; used for starting processes
\fB\-\-ifhn\fR specifies an alternate interface hostname for the host this mpd is running on;
.IP
e.g. may be used to specify the alias for an interface other than default
.PP
\fB\-\-listenport\fR specifies a port for this mpd to listen on; by default it will
.IP
acquire one from the system
.PP
\fB\-\-conlistenport\fR specifies a port for this mpd to listen on for console
.IP
connections (only used when employing inet socket for console); by default it
will acquire one from the system
.PP
\fB\-\-pid\fR=\fIfilename\fR writes the mpd pid into the specified file, or \fB\-\-pid\fR alone
.IP
writes it into /var/run/mpd.pid
.PP
\fB\-\-tmpdir\fR=\fItmpdirname\fR where mpd places temporary sockets, etc.
\fB\-zc\fR is a purely EXPERIMENTAL option right now used to investigate zeroconf
.IP
networking; it can be used to allow mpds to discover each other locally
using multicast DNS; its usage may change over time
Currently, \fB\-zc\fR is specified like this:  \fB\-zc\fR N
where N specifies a 'level' in a startup set of mpds.  The first mpd in a ring
must have 1 and it will establish a ring of one mpd.  Subsequent mpds can specify
\fB\-zc\fR 2 and will hook into the ring via the one at level 1.  Except for level 1, new
mpds enter the ring via an mpd at level\-1.
.PP
A file named .mpd.conf file must be present in the user's home directory
.IP
with read and write access only for the user, and must contain at least
a line with MPD_SECRETWORD=<secretword>
.PP
To run mpd as root, install it while root and instead of a .mpd.conf file
use mpd.conf (no leading dot) in the /etc directory.'
