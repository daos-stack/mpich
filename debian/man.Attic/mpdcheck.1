unrecognized \- manual page for mpdcheck command
.SH DESCRIPTION
mpdcheck
.PP
This script is a work in progress and may change frequently as we work
with users and gain additional insights into how to improve it.
.PP
This script prints useful information about the host on which it runs.
It is here to help us help users detect problems with configurations of
their computers.  For example, some computers are configured to think
of themselves simply as 'localhost' with 127.0.0.1 as the IP address.
This might present problems if a process on that computer wishes to
identify itself by host and port to a process on another computer.
The process on the other computer would try to contact 'localhost'.
.PP
If you are having problems running parallel jobs via mpd on one or more
hosts, you might try running this script once on each of those hosts.
.PP
Any output with *** at the beginning indicates a potential problem
that you may have to resolve before being able to run parallel jobs
via mpd.
