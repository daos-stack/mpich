MPICH for Debian
=================

MPI Alternatives
----------------
This package uses the Debian Alternatives system to allow you to choose
between the different MPI implementations.

You can check which version of MPI you use with
   update-alternatives --list mpirun
   update-alternatives --list mpi (for the development files)

Use 'update-alternatives --display' to list all installed implementations,
and 'update-alternatives --config' to configure which implementation to use.


=================
This work was heavily based on packaging work by Zach Lowry <zach@zachlowry.net>
and Muammar El Khatib <muammarelkhatib@gmail.com>.
